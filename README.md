## Description of Dataset and my Interests in it

The recent pandemic caused by the novel COVID-19 virus has caused 119,000 deaths in India. In humans, the virus is known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which may last long after diagnosis of the virus as well, causing lifelong damagaes to the body. 

The number of new cases are increasing day by day around the world. This dataset has information from the states and union territories of India at daily level.

I am particularly **interested** in this dataset as India recently became the 2nd country with the most cases and is not too far behind USA. I wasn to know why this happened and how India can make better decisions using this data. The main question I want to asnwer is, does the 21-day lockdown really work?

To easily and quickly provide an overview of the data, please read the following bullet points.

- **Why?**
  - The purpose of the dataset if to allow Data Analysts to find trends in the data and use to see how the Indian Government can take better actions to control the outbreak of the virus. 
  - In this project, I will try to find answers to:
    1. Whether India's 21 days of lockdown is useful.
    2. Who is most affected by COVID-19.
    3. Are there better techniques to control outbreaks?
    4. Are there certain communittes which are more severely affected by the virus?
 - **How the data was collected**
  - Data was collected from various digital sources and put together by:
    1. [SRK](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar)
